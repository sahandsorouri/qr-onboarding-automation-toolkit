## 🧠 Overview

The **QR Onboarding Automation Toolkit** was developed to slash merchant onboarding time from 30 days to just 7. It empowered internal sales agents to instantly onboard merchants by scanning or distributing QR codes that showed digital menus and triggered CRM sync.

Designed and led by the Head of Product, this solution was built in 10 weeks and later scaled to additional verticals across digital retail and q-commerce.

---

## ❗ Problem

Prior to launch, the merchant onboarding process was:

- Manual and time-consuming — Sales agents relied on paper forms and call center handoffs.
- Inefficient — Generating and printing QR codes took several days per merchant.
- Disjointed — Salesforce updates were delayed and error-prone.
- Unscalable — During COVID expansion, onboarding queues caused lead loss and merchant churn.

---

## 💡 Solution

We designed an end-to-end onboarding automation toolkit that allowed internal sales agents to:

- Instantly assign and scan pre-printed or auto-generated QR codes
- Show merchants a ready-to-use digital menu
- Auto-trigger onboarding flows, updating Salesforce within minutes
- Sync menus from restaurant delivery platforms or scraped sources
- Automate weekly updates with bi-directional Salesforce integration

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Node.js – Core backend logic and service orchestration
- PostgreSQL – Merchant data and SKU catalog store
- Docker – Containerized for dev/staging/production parity
- QR SDK – Dynamic QR code generation and routing
- Salesforce API – Weekly bi-directional CRM sync
